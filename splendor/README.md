# Introduction
Splendor is a game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, and shops, all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.

# Implementation
I and a group of other developers implemented Splendor as a part of the course COMP 361: Software Engineering Project at McGill University. This implementation uses REST, allowing multiple players to be able to play together over a network, Docker, allowing the backend to run smoothly no matter the operating system being used, Maven, for ensuring code quality on each version of the code, and JavaFX for designing the frontend.
