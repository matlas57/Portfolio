/**
 * The scene is constructed from a hierarchy of nodes, where each node
 * contains a transform, a material definition, some amount of geometry,
 * and some number of children nodes.  Each node has a unique name so that
 * it can be instanced elsewhere in the hierarchy (provided it does not
 * make loops.
 *
 * Note that if the material for a scene node is non-null, it should override
 * the intersect result material of any child.
