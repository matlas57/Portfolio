# Word Frequency Analysis Project

This project aimed to analyze the most frequent words used by the top 6 most speaking ponies in the show My Little Pony. Frequency analysis was done using two metrics, word counts and TF-IDF score.

Results of the word count analysis can be found in word_counts.json and results of the TF-IDF analysis can be found in Distinctive_pony_words.json
